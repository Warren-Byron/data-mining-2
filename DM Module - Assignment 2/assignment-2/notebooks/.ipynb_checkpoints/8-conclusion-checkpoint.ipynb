    "Despite the dataset's lack of predictive value, the assignment served as a good opportunity to learn about classification and clustering methods in general. To maximize efficiency and see relative changes, the hyperparameters and PCA n-components were tweaked. Working through these processes, as well as implementing feature engineering, was a rewarding experience.  I believe that if enough time was spent on the dataset, it might yield a valuable amount of knowledge. The task, I believe, introduced me to data mining as a means of extracting patterns from data using a number of sophisticated and intelligent methods.  I also saw how choices are made along the way that can have positive or negative effects later on. I have had a lot of fun learning and working with Python, which is a very strong and interesting scripting language with a lot of useful libraries."
