    "We were given a \"raw\" piece of data to work with as part of our assignment. In addition, we were given a set of classification and clustering tasks to complete using Jupyter and Python data mining toolsets on the data. Thankfully, there seems to be some leeway for us to use our ingenuity and creativity to find various approaches to the challenge.  The information comes from a survey of internet users conducted in the early days of the internet.\n",

It becomes a fascinating journey as I work through the techniques and tactics of data mining, which are relayed from the top of the notebook to the bottom.\n",
